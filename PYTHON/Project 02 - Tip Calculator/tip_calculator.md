# Project 02 - Bill Distributor

This project will calculate bill distribution among people. In this project, you are going to learn about following commands in **Python**:

1. `int()`
2. `float()`
3. `str()`
4. `print()`
5. `input()`

Soon, I will add the short description for each command I used in making of the project.



### Important ! 
Every time you enter something into the terminal as input, python will always consider this as a string. So, if you want to do some operations with enter value then you should convert `string` to either `int` or in `float`.
