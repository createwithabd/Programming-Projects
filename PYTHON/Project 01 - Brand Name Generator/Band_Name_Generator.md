# Project 01 - Brand Name Generator 

**Author:** Abdullah Amjad 

It is a simple project created for better understanding of following commands in `Python`;

1. `print()`
2. `input()` 
3. `title()`
4. `upper()`

This project will display a brand name simply by showing your brand category, and first letter of your first and last name. 

### Example

~~~~python
print("Welcome to the 'Brand Name Generator'")
category = input(f"What kind of company you are going to open?  ").title()
first_letter = input(f"What is the first letter of your First and Last name? ").upper()
print(f"Your Brand name is {first_letter} {category}")
~~~~



You can improvise this project as much you want.
