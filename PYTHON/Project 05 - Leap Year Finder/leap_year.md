# Project 05 - Leap Year Finder 

This program will see either your entered year is a leap year or not. In this code you are going to learn following things:

1. `ValueError`
2. `try:`
3. `except`
4. `Nested if statement` 

#### Leap Years List for Testing code: 

`[2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040, 2044, and 2048]` 

## Leap Year Rule: 

1. Year should be divisible by 4. 
2. Year should be divisible by 100 along with 400. [if year is divisible by 100, but not by 400 then this year is not a leap year.]
